# House price prediction for *Properati* (Real state company)

In this repo you can find an inplementation of some of the most important ML algorithms using the Scikit-Learn library to predict housing prices in *Buenos Aires, Argentina*. Both of the analysis that you'll find here are 

Project 1 is a first approach to accomplish this goal. Some of the models/algorithms and techniques implemented in this notebook are:

      * EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
      * Decision Trees
      * Linear Regression
      * KNN
      
In project 2 we use some of the more advanced models, as well as feature engineering techniques to use more available information in the dataset. Some of the models/algorithms and techniques implemented in this notebook are:

      * EDA
      * Outliers imputation
      * One-hot-encoding
      * Polynomial Regression (Ridge and Lasso)
      * Xgboost
      * PCA
